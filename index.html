  Welcome to the Deep Blue Sea!
  Hello there, matey! We are excited to have you all-aboard our deep sea exploration vessel. We are here to guide you as you discover the weird and wonderful creatures that live in each layer of the ocean. Make sure to take note of each layer and the animals found there for the fun quiz at the end of the page. 
  Scroll down and start sea-rching!

<h3>Epipelagic</h3>
<p>
  This is the surface layer of the ocean. This is also known as the sunlight zone because most of the visible light exists here.

<h3>Mesopelagic</h3>
<p>
  Also known as the twilight zone, the light that penetrates to this depth is extremely faint. A great diversity of strange fishes can be found here.

<h3>Bathypelagic</h3>
<p>
  Sometimes referred to as the midnight zone, the only visible light is that produced by the creatures themselves. Most of the animals that live at these depths are black or red in color due to the lack of light.

<h3>Abyssopelagic</h3>
<p>
  Also known as the abyssal zone or simply as the abyss, the water temperature is near freezing, and there is no light at all. Very few creatures can be found at these crushing depths.

<h3>Hadalpelagic</h3>
<p>
  These areas are mostly found in deep water trenches and canyons. In spite of the intense pressure and extremely cold temperature, life can still be found here. Invertebrates can thrive at these depths.
